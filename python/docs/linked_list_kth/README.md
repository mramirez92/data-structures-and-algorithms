# Singly Linked List
Challenge was to add on on to linked_list.py, adding a method that returns node from kth(2nd from, 3rd from last etc) of end of list. 

## Challenge

## kth from end
kth from end
argument: a number, k, as a parameter.
Return the nodeâ€™s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.

## Approach & Efficiency
Wasnt able to test, error with my file.
