# Binary Search

## Whiteboard Process
Create a function called binarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array

## Approach & Efficiency
Create a function that searches for given value index. List is split in half using floor math. If x is greater than element at half index, ignore lower half. I value is smaller than upper half, ignore upper half. keep searching until value is at halfway point, return index. If value is not in list, return -1
