# Tree-K-ary
Implementation of k-ary method function that modifies tree. 

Author: Monica Ramirez

## Challenge
Write a function called fizz buzz tree
Arguments: k-ary tree
Return: new k-ary tree
Determine whether or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same structure as the original, but the values modified as follows:

If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
If the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply turn the number into a String.

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O notation for this method depends on the tree height and number of nodes, because of this the find_maximum_value method functions at O(n). 

## Solution:
